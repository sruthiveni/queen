This pseudocode uses a backtracking algorithm to find a solution to the 8 Queen problem, which consists of placing 8 queens on a chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other.
The algorithm starts by placing a queen on the first column, then it proceeds to the next column and places a queen in the first safe row of that column.
If the algorithm reaches the 8th column and all queens are placed in a safe position, it prints the board and returns true.
If the algorithm is unable to place a queen in a safe position in a certain column, it backtracks to the previous column and tries a different row.
The “isSafe” function checks if it is safe to place a queen on a certain row and column by checking if there are any queens in the same row, diagonal or anti-diagonal.
It’s worth to notice that this is just a high-level pseudocode and it might need to be adapted depending on the specific implementation and language you are using.
